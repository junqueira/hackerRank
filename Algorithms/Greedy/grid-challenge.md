## Grid Challenge

**Problem Statement**

Given a squared sized grid **G** of size **N** in which each cell has a lowercase letter. Denote the character in the **i**th row and in the **j**th column as **G[i][j]**.

You can perform one operation as many times as you like: Swap two column adjacent characters in the same row **G[i][j]** and **G[i][j + 1]** for all valid **i, j**.

Is it possible to rearrange the grid such that the following condition is true?

**G[i][1] ≤ G[i][2] ≤ ⋯ ≤ G[i][N]** for **1 ≤ i ≤ N** and
**G[1][j] ≤ G[2][j] ≤ ⋯ ≤ G[N][j]** for **1 ≤ j ≤ N**

In other words, is it possible to rearrange the grid such that every row and every column is lexicographically sorted?

**Note**: **c_1 ≤ c_2**, if letter **c_1** is equal to **c_2** or is before **c_2** in the alphabet.

**Input Format**

The first line begins with **T**, the number of testcases. In each testcase you will be given **N**.The following **N** lines contain **N** lowercase english alphabet each, describing the grid.

**Output Format**

Print **T** lines. On the **i** th line print `YES` if it is possible to rearrange the grid in the **i** th testcase or `NO` otherwise.

**Constraints**

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
G<sub>ij</sub> will be a lower case letter

**Sample Input**

    1
    5
    ebacd
    fghij
    olmkn
    trpqs
    xywuv

**Sample Output**

    YES

**Explanation**

The grid in the first and only testcase can be reordered to

    abcde
    fghij
    klmno
    pqrst
    uvwxy

This fulfills the condition since the rows 1, 2, …, 5 and the columns 1, 2, …, 5 are all lexicographically sorted.
