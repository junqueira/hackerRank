## Chief Hopper

**Problem Statement**

Chief’s bot is playing an old DOS-based game. There are *N+1* buildings in the game - indexed from *0* to *N* and are placed left-to-right. It is guaranteed that building with index *0* will be of height *0* unit. For buildings with index *i* (*i ∈ [1, N]*) height will be *h<sub>i</sub>* units.
At beginning Chief’s bot is at building with index *0*. At each step, bot jumps to next (right) building. Suppose bot is at *k<sup>th</sup>* building and his current energy is *botEnergy*, then in next step he will jump to *(k+1)<sup>th</sup>* building. He will gain/lose energy equal in amount to difference between *h<sub>k+1</sub>* and *botEnergy*

-   If *h<sub>k+1</sub> > botEnergy*, then he will lose *h<sub>k+1</sub> - botEnergy* units of energy.
-   Otherwise, he will gain *botEnergy - h<sub>k+1</sub>* units of energy.

Goal is to reach *N<sup>th</sup>* building, and during the course bot should never have negative energy units. What should be the minimum units of energy with which bot should start to successfully complete the game?

**Input Format**

The first line contains integer *N*. Next line contains *N* space separated integers *h<sub>1</sub>, h<sub>2</sub>,⋯ , h<sub>N</sub>* representing the heights of the buildings.

**Output Format**

Print a single number representing minimum units of energy required to complete the game.

**Constraints**

*1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>5</sup>*

*1 ≤ h_i ≤ 10^5, i ∈ [1, N]*

**Sample Output**

    4

**Explanation**

**Sample 1**

If initial energy is 4, after step 1 energy is 5, after step 2 it’s 6, after step 3 it’s 9 and after step 4 it’s 16, finally at step 5 it’s 28.

You can verify for lower initial energy bot will have -ve energy in the end.

**Sample 2**

In the second test case if bot has energy 4, it’s energy is changed by (4 - 4 = 0) at every step and remains 4.
