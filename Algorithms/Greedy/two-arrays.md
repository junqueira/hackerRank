## Two arrays

**Problem Statement**

You are given two integer arrays, *A* and *B*, each containing *N* integers. The size of the array is less than or equal to 1000. You are free to permute the order of the elements in the arrays.

Now here’s the real question: Is there an permutation *A’*, *B’* possible of *A* and *B*, such that, *A’<sub>i</sub>+B’<sub>i</sub>* ≥ *K* for all *i*, where *A’<sub>i</sub>* denotes the *i<sup>th</sup>* element in the array *A’* and *B’<sub>i</sub>* denotes *i<sup>th</sup>* element in the array *B’*.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, *T*, the number of test-cases. *T* test cases follow. Each test case has the following format:

The first line contains two integers, *N* and *K*. The second line contains *N* space separated integers, denoting array *A*. The third line describes array *B* in a same format.

**Output Format**

For each test case, if such an arrangement exists, output “YES”, otherwise “NO” (without quotes).

**Constraints**

* 1 <= *T* <= 10
* 1 <= *N* <= 1000
* 1 <= *K* <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* 0<= *A<sub>i</sub>*, *B<sub>i</sub>* ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>

**Sample Input**

    2
    3 10
    2 1 3
    7 8 9
    4 5
    1 2 2 1
    3 3 3 4

**Sample Output**

    YES
    NO

**Explanation**

The first input has 3 elements in Array *A* and Array *B*, we see that the one of the arrangements, 3 2 1 and 7 8 9 has each pair of elements (3+7, 2 + 8 and 9 + 1) summing upto 10 and hence the answer is “YES”.

The second input has array B with three 3s. So, we need at least three numbers in A that are greater than 1. As this is not the case, the answer is “NO”.
