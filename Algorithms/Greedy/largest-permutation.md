## Largest Permutation

**Problem Statement**

You are given an array of **N** integers which is a permuation of the first **N** natural numbers. You can swap any two elements of the array. You can make at most **K** swaps. What is the lexicographically largest permutation you can make?

**Input Format**

The first line of the input contains two integers, **N** and **K**, the size of the input array and the maximum swaps you can make, respectively. The second line of the input contains a permutation of the first **N** natural numbers.

**Output Format**

Print the lexicographically largest permutation you can make with **at most** **K** swaps.

**Constraints**

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^9

**Sample Input\#00**

    5 1
    4 2 3 5 1

**Sample Output\#00**

    5 2 3 4 1

**Explanation\#00**

You can swap any two numbers in [4,2,3,5,1] and see the largest permutation is [5,2,3,4,1]

**Sample Input\#01**

    3 1
    2 1 3

**Sample Output\#01**

    3 1 2

**Explanation\#01**

With 1 swap we can get [1,2,3], [3,1,2] and [2,3,1] out of these [3,1,2] is the largest permutation.

**Sample Input\#02**

    2 1
    2 1

**Sample Output\#02**

    2 1

**Explanation\#02**

We can see that [2,1] is already the largest permutation. So we don’t need any swaps.
