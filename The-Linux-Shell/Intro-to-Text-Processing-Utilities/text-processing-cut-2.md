## Text Processing in Linux - The Cut Command - #2

**Problem Statement**

**Task**

Display the second and seventh character from each line of text.

**Input Format**

A text file with lines of ASCII text only.

**Input Constraints**

1 <= **N** <= 100 (N is the number of lines of text in the input file) Note: These values don’t really impact your command.

**Output Format**

The output should contain **N** lines.Each line should contain just the two characters of the corresponding input line (the ones at the second and the seventh position).

Do **not** code defensively for situations where the text is short and the required characters may not be present in a line of text. ‘cut’ will handle it and will simply not display any character or line in such a situation.

**Sample Input**

    Hello
    World
    how are you

**Sample Output**

    e
    o
    oe

[This][] is a very well written tutorial demonstrating different ways in which ‘cut’ may be used to either print characters at a particular position, or to print columns of a text file, based on delimiters. The latter is particularly useful while dealing with tabulated data in \*.tsv or \*.csv format.
