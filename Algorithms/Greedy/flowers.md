## Flowers

**Problem Statement**

You and your *K-1* friends want to buy *N* flowers. Flower number *i* has cost *c<sub>i</sub>*. Unfortunately the seller does not want just one customer to buy a lot of flowers, so he tries to change the price of flowers for customers who have already bought some flowers. More precisely, if a customer has already bought *x* flowers, he should pay *(x+1)\*c<sub>i</sub>* dollars to buy flower number *i*.
 You and your *K-1* friends want to buy all *N* flowers in such a way that you spend the least amount of money. You can buy the flowers in any order.

**Input:**

The first line of input contains two integers *N* and *K (K \<= N)*. The next line contains *N* space separated positive integers *c<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,…,c<sub>N</sub>*.

**Output:**

Print the minimum amount of money you (and your friends) have to pay in order to buy all *N* flowers.

**Constraint :**

1 \<= *N*, *K* \<= 100
 Any *c<sub>i</sub>* is not more than 1,000,000

**Sample input \#00**

    3 3
    2 5 6

**Sample output \#00**

    13

**Sample input \#01**

    3 2
    2 5 6

**Sample output \#01**

    15

**Explanation :**
 *Sample Case \#00:* In this example, all of you should buy one flower each. Hence, you’ll have to pay 13 dollars.
 *Sample Case \#01:* Here one of the friend buys first two flowers in decreasing order of their price. So he will pay `(0+1)*5 + (1+1)*2 = 9`. And other friend will buy the costliest flower of cost `6`. So total money need is `9+6=15`.
